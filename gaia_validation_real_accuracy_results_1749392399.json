      "question": "I have the Standard plan in the image below, and I just uploaded 60 equally sized files and got a message that I'm 100GB over the limit. I have 980 more files of the same size to upload. What is the a...",
      "ai_answer": "Okay, I will analyze the problem and provide the answer in the requested format.\n\nHere's the breakdown:\n\n1.  **Current Plan Limit:** The Standard plan has a limit of 2 TB (2000 GB).\n2.  **Overage:** You are 100 GB over the limit, meaning you are currently using 2100 GB of storage.\n3.  **File Size:** 60 files = 100 GB overage. Therefore, each file is approximately 100GB / 60 files = 1.6666666666666667 GB per file.\n4.  **Total Storage Needed:** You want to upload 980 more files. These files will take up 980 files * 1.6666666666666667 GB/file ≈ 1633.3333333333333 GB of space.\n5.  **Total Storage After Upload:** After uploading, you will need 2100 GB + 1633.3333333333333 GB = 3733.3333333333335 GB.\n6.  **Required Plan:** You need to upgrade to the Premium plan, which offers 5 TB (5000 GB) of storage.\n7.  **Upgrade Cost:** The upgrade cost is $20 - $10 = $10.\n8.  **Number of Additional Files:** The files causing you to upgrade are the 980 remaining files plus the amount you already went over.\n9. **Cost per file** 10/980 =  0.0102040816\n10. **Format as Request** 0.01\n\nTherefore, the answer is: 0.01",

      "question": "Use density measures from the chemistry materials licensed by Marisa Alviar-Agnew & Henry Agnew under the CK-12 license in LibreText's Introductory Chemistry materials as compiled 08/21/2023.\n\nI have ...",
      "ai_answer": "Okay, I will use the density information from the specified LibreTexts' Introductory Chemistry materials to solve this problem. Since I don't have direct access to those materials (compiled 08/21/2023), I will use common density values for honey and mayonnaise at 25°C found in reliable online sources, and clearly state my assumptions.\n\n**Here's the approach and solution:**\n\n1.  **Density Assumptions:**\n    *   Honey Density:  Approximately 1.42 g/mL (This can vary depending on the type of honey, but this is a reasonable average)\n    *   Mayonnaise Density: Approximately 0.91 g/mL (This also varies depending on the brand and type of mayonnaise)\n\n2.  **Volume Conversions:**\n    *   1 gallon = 16 cups\n    *   1 cup = 236.588 mL (approximately)\n\n3.  **Calculations:**\n\n    *   **Weight of 1 Gallon of Honey:** (16 cups) \\* (236.588 mL/cup) \\* (1.42 g/mL) = 5371.6 g (approximately)\n    *   **Weight of 1 Gallon of Mayonnaise:** (16 cups) \\* (236.588 mL/cup) \\* (0.91 g/mL) = 3441.7 g (approximately)\n\n4.  **Determining the Number of Cups to Remove:** We want to find out how many cups of honey need to be removed so that the remaining honey weighs less than the mayonnaise.  Let 'x' be the number of cups to remove.\n\n    *   Weight of Honey After Removal:  5371.6 g - (x cups \\* 236.588 mL/cup \\* 1.42 g/mL)\n    *   We want this weight to be less than the weight of the mayonnaise: 5371.6 - (x \\* 236.588 \\* 1.42) < 3441.7\n\n5.  **Solve the Inequality:**\n\n    *   5371.6 - 335.95x < 3441.7\n    *   1929.9 < 335.95x\n    *   x > 1929.9 / 335.95\n    *   x > 5.74\n\n6.  **Conclusion:** Since we can only remove whole cups, we need to remove **6** cups of honey for the remaining honey to weigh less than the gallon of mayonnaise.\n\n**Answer:**\n\nYou will need to remove 6 cups of honey for the remaining honey to weigh less than the gallon of mayonnaise, based on the assumed densities.\n\n**Important Notes:**\n\n*   The accuracy of this answer depends entirely on the accuracy of the density values used. Ideally, I would have directly used the data from the specified LibreTexts materials.\n*   Real-world densities can vary based on temperature, composition, and manufacturer. If higher precision is needed, directly measuring the densities of the specific honey and mayonnaise is recommended.",
