      "question": "Suppose a dog can split into two dogs to make two slightly smaller dogs 75% the weight of the original dog.\n\nI have a 180-pound dog and I define a teacup dog as a dog under 4 pounds. The dog splits it...",
      "ai_answer": "Here's the breakdown to solve this problem:\n\n1. **Weight Reduction:** Each split results in two dogs, each weighing 75% (0.75) of the original dog's weight.\n\n2. **Target Weight:** We want to find out how many splits it takes for a dog to weigh less than 4 pounds (teacup dog).\n\n3. **Calculations:**\n\n   *  Let 'n' be the number of splits. After 'n' splits, starting with a 180-pound dog, each resulting dog will weigh 180 * (0.75)^n / (2^n) pounds.  (Note: after n splits there will be 2^n dogs) \n\n   *  We want to find the smallest 'n' such that: 180 * (0.75)^n  < 4.\n\n   *  Divide both sides by 180: (0.75)^n < 4/180 = 1/45\n\n   *  Take the natural logarithm of both sides: n * ln(0.75) < ln(1/45)\n\n   *  Divide both sides by ln(0.75). Remember that ln(0.75) is negative, so we need to reverse the inequality sign: n > ln(1/45) / ln(0.75)\n\n   *  Calculate: n > -3.80666 / -0.28768 ≈ 13.23\n\n   *  Since 'n' must be an integer, we round up to n = 14 splits.\n\n4. **Number of Teacup Dogs:** After 14 splits, there will be 2^14 teacup dogs.\n\n5. **Final Answer:** 2^14 = 16384\n\nTherefore, there will be **16384** teacup dogs.",

The core task is to find the indefinite integral of each polynomial, then identify the coefficient of the *cubic term* in each integrated expression, and finally sum those coefficients.

Indefinite Integrals:**\n\n*   **95x^3 - 3x^2 - 19x - 1:**  The indefinite integral is (95/4)x^4 - x^3 - (19/2)x^2 - x + C.  The coefficient of the x^3 term is **-1**.\n\n*   **13x^2 - 5^x - 38:** The indefinite integral is (13/3)x^3 - ∫5^x dx - 38x + C.  We only care about the polynomial part, so the coefficient of the x^3 term is **13/3**.\n\n*   **-19x^5 + x^4 + 2x^3 - 3x^2 - 5^x + 10:** The indefinite integral is (-19/6)x^6 + (1/5)x^5 + (1/2)x^4 - x^3 - ∫5^x dx + 10x + C.
